# MOCacheDemo
## Introduction
This is a demonstration of a cache management tool called *MOCache* for moving object databases.
Thank you for reviewing.

MoCache is implemented in an open-source and extensible moving object database system **SECONDO**,  which is introducted in [the web page](https://secondo-database.github.io/). You can install the database according to the 'Installation Instructions'.
