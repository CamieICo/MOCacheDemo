# MOCacheDemo
## Introduction
The video is a demonstration of a cache management tool called *MOCache* for moving object databases.
Thank you for reviewing.

MoCache is implemented in an open-source and extensible moving object database system **SECONDO**. First, you should install SECONDO according to the 'Installation Instructions' in [this web page](https://secondo-database.github.io/). Then find these files and folders on your local secondo directory.
+ Flob
+ gui
+ SecondoInterfaceTTY.cpp
+ SecondoTTY.cpp
+ SystemTables.h

At last, replace them with the files in our repository.

## Usage
You can compile and use the system. When executing SECONDO's query commands,  MOCache can do cache management.
